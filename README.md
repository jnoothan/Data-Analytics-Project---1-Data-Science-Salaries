# 📊 Data Science Salaries Analysis

This project is a data analytics exercise that explores global data science salaries using a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/data-science-salaries-2023). The objective is to gain insights into the distribution of salaries across roles, experience levels, company types, and geographic locations using Python, Power BI, and data analysis libraries.

---

## 🔍 Project Objectives

- Load and clean the dataset.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Visualize trends in data science salaries.
- Analyze correlations between features like experience, employment type, company size, and remote ratio.
- Provide actionable insights from the analysis using both Python and Power BI dashboards.
